# Openfront Dealership: schema map

Step 1 of the platform coverage brief (`~/Code/Euler/state/briefs/platform-coverage-2026-10-23.md`). Written from a full read of `features/keystone/models/**`, `features/keystone/access.ts`, `features/keystone/lifecycle/**`, `features/keystone/mutations/**`, the onboarding seed, every platform slice under `features/platform/**` with its route wrappers under `app/dashboard/(admin)/platform/**`, and the storefront under `app/(storefront)/**` and `features/storefront/**`. Read only; nothing was run.

Conventions used below:

- **Write path.** "Command only" means the list's `access.operation.create` and `update` are `() => false` or `denyAll`, so every write goes through a custom mutation (or a hook or seed running as sudo). "Open CRUD" means Keystone create/update are allowed for the named permission, so the generic `/dashboard/<list>` pages can write it.
- **Rooftop scoping.** Almost every operating list has `rooftop: rooftopField()` (`features/keystone/tenantRecords.ts:12`) and a `withRooftopScope` / `withRooftopPermissionScope` filter (`tenantRecords.ts:30`). Item create is gated by `canCreateRooftopRecord` (`tenantRecords.ts:107`). Permissions resolve from the user's Role, and the operating permissions can also come from an active dealer-group or rooftop membership role for that scope only (`access.ts:45-73`).
- **Audit.** Every custom command writes a `DomainAuditEvent` plus a `DomainOutboxEvent` in the same transaction through `recordDomainEventInTransaction` (`lifecycle/domainEvents.ts:54-112`). The idempotency key is the event key, so a retry with the same key replays and a reused key with different evidence throws. This is why most lists are command-only.
- **Registered lists.** `features/keystone/models/index.ts:73-145` registers **71** lists, not 73. The other four files in the folder are helpers: `fields.ts` (Role permission checkboxes), `trackingFields.ts` (`createdAt` and `updatedAt`), `prismaSchema.ts` and `index.ts`. `AuthenticationThrottle` is registered, but it is GraphQL-omitted and unused (`AuthenticationThrottle.ts:1-9`).
- **Platform route** means `/dashboard/platform/<slice>`. A thin wrapper lives at `app/dashboard/(admin)/platform/<slice>/page.tsx`, and the logic lives in `features/platform/<slice>`. **Generic page** means the Keystone model pages at `/dashboard/<list>` (`app/dashboard/(admin)/[listKey]/**`). Generic pages do not count as platform coverage.

## Permissions (Role checkboxes, `models/fields.ts:3-100`)

| Group | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Role only (`access.ts:48-62`) | `canAccessDashboard`, `canSeeOtherPeople`, `canEditOtherPeople`, `canManagePeople`, `canReadUsers`, `canManageUsers`, `canReadRoles`, `canManageRoles`, `canManageSettings`, `canManageOnboarding`, `canManageKeys`, `canReadPayments`, `canManagePayments` |
| Role or scoped membership role | `canManageDealerships`, `canViewInventory`, `canManageInventory`, `canManageLeads`, `canViewAllLeads`, `canManageDeals`, `canApproveDeals`, `canManageTradeIns`, `canManageFinancing`, `canManageService`, `canViewReports` |
| Derived (`access.ts:83-101`) | `canViewInventory` = view or manage inventory. `canAccessDeals` = deals, approve or financing. `canAccessTradeIns` = trade-ins, deals or leads. `canAccessLeads` = leads, deals, service, financing or trade-ins. `canManageTasks` = leads, financing or service. `canViewDealerCost` = manage inventory or financing across **all** rooftops. |
| Row filters (`access.ts:103-228`) | Leads, lead children, deals, deal approvals and trade-ins are limited to the assigned salesperson unless the user has `canViewAllLeads` across all rooftops (`access.ts:159-219`). |

API-key sessions are restricted again by the key's scopes (`access.ts:69-71`, `utils/apiKeyPolicy.ts`).

## 1. Lists

Columns: **Purpose**, **Key fields**, **Relationships**, **Created by**, **States and transitions**, **Direct write** (whether Keystone create/update is open or the list is command-only).

### 1.1 Org and access

| List | Purpose | Key fields | Relationships | Created by | States and transitions | Direct write |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **User** | Staff login, and also storefront customer login | name, email (unique), password, phone, employeeId, commissionRate, isSalesperson / isServiceAdvisor / isFinanceManager, onboardingStatus (`not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `dismissed`) | role → Role; read-only reverse lists: dealerGroupMemberships, rooftopMemberships, assignedLeads, deals, tasks, interactions, dealApprovals, apiKeys, customerAppointments / techAppointments (ServiceAppointment), lead-assignment events, sales visits | Staff: generic `createUser` with `canManagePeople` (`User.ts:12`), or through the `/platform/users` invite. Customer: `registerCustomerAccount` (`mutations/customerAccount.ts:5-14`, sudo, onboardingStatus `dismissed`). First admin: `/dashboard/init`. | onboardingStatus is set by `updateActiveUser` (`mutations/updateActiveUser.ts`). No other states. | Open: create/delete need `canManagePeople`; update is allowed for self or `canUpdatePeople` (`User.ts:9-19`). `role` can only be changed with `canManageRoles`, and never on yourself (`User.ts:64-77`). |
| **Role** | Permission bundle | name, plus every permission checkbox | assignedTo → User[]; dealerGroupMemberships, rooftopMemberships | `/platform/users` and generic pages (`canManageRoles`). Onboarding seeds staff roles through `ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord` entity `Role` (`ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord.ts:424-443`; codes sales-manager, sales-associate, finance-manager, service-manager, service-advisor, technician, parts-specialist, office-manager, lines 75-87). | none | Open with `canManageRoles` (`Role.ts:10-21`). |
| **DealerGroup** | The dealer group, the tenant root | name, slug (unique), legalName, status (`active`, `suspended`, `archived`) | rooftops, memberships, membershipAuditEvents | Onboarding `Dealership` entity (`ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord.ts:129-227`); generic page with `canManageDealerships` | Status select only.

Vehicle writes require an active rooftop (`Vehicle.ts:36-46`). | Open; delete denied |
| **DealerGroupMembership** | A user's access to a whole group; `accessAllRooftops` gives group-wide access | user, dealerGroup, role, status (`invited`, `active`, `suspended`, `revoked`), accessAllRooftops, invitedBy, joinedAt | User, DealerGroup, Role | `changeDealerMembership` with scopeType `dealer-group` (`mutations/changeDealerMembership.ts:23`); onboarding bootstrap | Any status to any status through the command, with guards in `mutations/membershipPolicy.ts:23-46`: you cannot change your own membership, a reason is required, and rooftop memberships cannot grant group-wide access | Command only (`DealerGroupMembership.ts:11-16`; every field `update: denyAll`) |
| **RooftopMembership** | A user's access to one rooftop | user, rooftop, role, status (same four values), invitedBy, joinedAt | User, Rooftop, Role | `changeDealerMembership` with scopeType `rooftop`; onboarding | Same as above | Command only (`RooftopMembership.ts:11-16`) |

| **ApiKey** | Programmatic access token for the key owner | name, tokenSecret (hashed `of_…`), tokenPreview, scopes (`read_inventory`, `write_inventory`, `write_leads`, `write_deals`, `write_service`, `read_reports`; `ApiKey.ts:16-23`), status (`active`, `inactive`, `revoked`), expiresAt, lastUsedAt, usageCount, restrictedToIPs | user (set from the session) | The owner, through the generic page only (`ApiKey.ts:31-44`; human sessions only, own keys only) | A revoked key cannot be reactivated (`ApiKey.ts:51`) | Open to the owner |
| **AuthenticationThrottle** | Unused legacy rows | keyHash, purpose, failureCount, blockedUntil | none | Nothing | none | Everything denied; GraphQL-omitted |

Intake stocks the unit as `service`, and `transitionInventoryAcquisition` sets `available` at frontline (`transitionInventoryAcquisition.ts:117-122`). The desk also labels `hold` (`lifecycle/inventoryPublication.ts:80`), but that value is not a select option. | Command only (`Vehicle.ts:12-24`); status is `update: false`. The afterOperation hook writes a domain event (`Vehicle.ts:59-92`). Delete is blocked once the vehicle is referenced (`Vehicle.ts:47-57`). |
| **VehicleImage** | Gallery photo | image (stored file), imagePath (static), caption, category (`exterior`, `interior`, `engine`, `damage`), sortOrder, isPrimary | vehicle | `addInventoryVehiclePhoto`, `arrangeInventoryVehiclePhotos`, `removeInventoryVehiclePhoto` (`mutations/inventoryPhotoCommands.ts:109,152,175`); `updateInventoryMerchandisingDraft` imagePath (`inventoryPublishingCommands.ts:92-93`); intake | none.

Command: `transitionLead`; closed-lost needs a structured reason (`operatorWorkflows.ts:39`). Side effects: `recordLeadInteraction` moves `new` → `contacted` (`:117`); completing a test drive moves the lead to `negotiating` or `contacted` (`:139-168`). Cadence: `enrollLeadCadence` sets `active` and `advanceLeadCadence` steps it (`crmEngagementWorkflows.ts:115-226`). | Command only: create, update and delete are `denyAll` (`Lead.ts:11-17`) |
| **LeadAssignmentEvent** | Assignment history | reason, routeKey, assignedAt, firstResponseDueAt | lead, fromUser, toUser, actor | `transferLeadOwnership` (`operatorCommands.ts:47`, routeKey `manual-transfer`); `routeLead` (`crmIdentityWorkflows.ts:270`) | none | Command only |

No reopen, edit or delete. | Command only (`Task.ts:11-17`) |
| **SalesVisit** | Showroom visit or sales appointment, with a manager "turn" (T.O.) | kind (`appointment`, `showroom`), status, scheduled/arrived/managerTurn/completedAt, outcome, notes | lead, customer, vehicle, assignedSalesperson, manager | `manageSalesVisit` action `schedule` (`crmEngagementWorkflows.ts:278-351`) | `scheduled` → `arrived` / `cancelled` / `no-show`; `arrived` → `manager-turn` / `completed` / `cancelled`; `manager-turn` → `completed` / `cancelled` (`crmEngagementWorkflows.ts:271-276`) | Command only |

Merchant: the same mutation from `/platform/test-drives`. | open → license verified → completed (needs verification), or open → no-show (only after the scheduled time). Command: `updateTestDriveWorkflow` (`operatorWorkflows.ts:126-173`). Completed is immutable. No reschedule or cancel command. | Command only (`TestDrive.ts:11-22`) |
| **TradeIn** | Customer's car offered in trade | vin, year, make, model, trim, mileage, condition (`excellent`, `good`, `fair`, `poor`), exterior/interior condition, mechanicalIssues, kbbValueCents (reference value), offerAmountCents, mainPhoto; virtual referenceValue, offerAmount | lead (create/update denied), deal, appraisedBy | Customer: `submitTradeIn` (`submitTradeIn.ts:92-127`).

On cash it also creates a `captured` operator-recorded PaymentTransaction and runs the prerequisite review (`financeOperations.ts:234-262`). | Any of the five statuses can be set. `clear-to-fund` and `funded` need no open checklist or exception items, an approved or financed deal, and reviewed prerequisites; delivered funding is frozen (`financeOperations.ts:164-209`). Funding gate: `lifecycle/dealFinanceEvidence.ts:115-129`. Finance desk step plan: `lifecycle/financePrerequisites.ts:201-266`. | Command only |
| **FinanceProductCancellation** | Cancelling a sold F&I product, with the refund amount | productCode, status (`requested`, `completed`, `denied`), reason, refundCents, evidence | deal, menu (must be an accepted menu that contains the product) | `recordFinanceProductCancellation` (`financeOperations.ts:284`). Records evidence only: it creates **no** PaymentRefund and does not change Deal.products. | Recorded per status (append) | Command only |

Prerequisite review (no list of its own): `reviewFinancePrerequisites` writes a `prerequisites-reviewed` DomainAuditEvent that funding needs on finance or lease deals (`mutations/financePrerequisiteReview.ts`; checked in `financePrerequisites.ts:153-171`).

### 1.6 Delivery

| List | Purpose | Key fields | Relationships | Created by | States and transitions | Direct write |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DeliveryCase** | Delivery appointment, checklist and customer sign-off | status (`scheduled`, `arrived`, `ready`, `delivered`, `cancelled`), appointmentAt, arrivedAt, checklist (identity, insurance, registration, title-handoff, plus funding derived from the funding case), customerAcknowledgment, acknowledgedAt, deliverySnapshot | deal (one per deal), weOweItems | `manageDeliveryCase` action `schedule` (`deliveryOperations.ts:66-69`); the deal must be `financed` | `schedule` → `scheduled`; `arrive` (needs scheduled) → `arrived`; `record-checklist` keeps the status and clears the acknowledgment; `acknowledge` (needs the four items and current funding) → `ready`; `cancel` → `cancelled` (`deliveryOperations.ts:66-92`). `ready` → `delivered` through `completeDealDelivery`, which also sets Deal `delivered` and Vehicle `sold` (`operatorCommands.ts:254-319`). | Command only |
| **WeOweItem** | Promise owed to the customer after the sale | description, status (`open`, `fulfilled`, `waived`), promisedAt, owner, estimatedCostCents, fulfillmentEvidence, customerAcknowledgment, fulfilledAt | deliveryCase, owner | `manageWeOweItem` action `create` (`deliveryOperations.ts:104`) | `open` → `fulfilled` / `waived` (actions `fulfill` / `waive`, `deliveryOperations.ts:104`) | Command only |

### 1.7 Service and parts

A provider webhook capture also sets `paid` (`paymentOperations.ts:201`). | Command only (`ServiceOrder.ts:13-25`); the validate hook blocks status edits and locked edits |
| **RepairOrderLineItem** | Priced RO line | itemType (`labor`, `part`, `sublet`), description, partNumber, quantity, unitPriceCents, priceCents, costCents | serviceOrder | `addServiceOrderLineItem` (`operatorCommands.ts:350-389`; recomputes the RO totals; only while estimate, approved or in-progress) | Locked once the RO is completed (`RepairOrderLineItem.ts:36-50`).

Nothing sets `partially-received`. | Command only |

### 1.8 Payments and accounting

| List | Purpose | Key fields | Relationships | Created by | States and transitions | Direct write |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PaymentProvider** | Configured payment adapter | name, code (`pp_…`), isInstalled, credentials, metadata, adapter function names | transactions | Onboarding `ensurePaymentProvider` (2 in the seed); generic page | isInstalled flag | Open CRUD with `canManagePayments` (no rooftop scope) |

Webhooks move it to `captured`, `canceled` or `failed`, and refunds move it to `partially-refunded` or `refunded` (`paymentOperations.ts:164-205`). `reconcilePaymentTransaction` sets reconciledAt on a settled payment (`:147-162`). | Command only |
| **PaymentRefund** | Refund against a captured payment | amountCents, reason, status (`creating`, `pending`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`), providerRefundId | transaction | `requestPaymentRefund` (`paymentOperations.ts:112-145`; captured or partially-refunded only, capped at the remaining captured amount) | `creating` → `pending` / `failed`; the webhook moves it to `succeeded` (`:186-189`) | Command only |

### 1.11 Onboarding seed (`features/platform/onboarding/lib/seed.json`)

`ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord(entity, data)` needs `canManageOnboarding` (`ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord.ts:459-470`). It dispatches to these handlers (`:445-457`): Dealership, Make, Model, Vehicle, ServicePackage, Part, FinanceProduct, LeadRoutingRule, AccountingMapping, PaymentProvider and Role.

| Seed key | Count (Complete) | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| dealership | 1 | DealerGroup `sams-motor-company`; Rooftop `SAM-MAIN` / slug `main` (time zone defaults to America/New_York; USD only); DealershipProfile (fills empty fields only); a DealerGroupMembership for the operator with all-rooftop access, and a MembershipAuditEvent `onboarding-bootstrap` (`ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord.ts:129-220`) |
| vehicleMakes / vehicleModels | 8 / 13 | Make, Model |
| vehicles | 13 | Through `intakeInventoryVehicleInTransaction`: Vehicle, VehicleImage, InventoryAcquisition (+ event), InventoryStock (+ event), a completed InventoryReconWorkItem, an approved InventoryMerchandisingVersion and a succeeded InventoryFeedRun (`intakeInventoryVehicle.ts:317-472`), so the units come out listed |
| services | 8 | ServicePackage |
| parts | 8 | PartsInventory through `configurePart`, plus a PartsMovement `receipt` "Opening stock" for the starting quantity |
| financeProducts | 5 | FinanceProduct through `configureFinanceProduct` (operator-recorded, active) |
| leadRoutingRules | 5 | LeadRoutingRule through `configureLeadRoutingRule`; the assignee is the onboarding user |
| accountingMappings | 11 | AccountingMapping through `configureAccountingMapping` |
| paymentProviders | 2 | PaymentProvider `pp_system_default` (Manual) and `pp_stripe_stripe` (Stripe), insert only |
| staff | 8 | Role only, no Users (Sales Manager, Sales Associate, Finance Manager, Service Manager, Service Advisor, Technician, Parts Specialist, Office Manager). Needs `canManageRoles`. |

The Basic template uses label-filtered subsets (`features/platform/onboarding/config/templates.tsx:49-66`). The seed creates no leads, customers, deals, appointments, ROs, financing applications or payments. Every transactional desk starts empty.

## 2. Merchant workflows, end to end

Each step lists the lists it touches, the command it uses, and the platform page that does it today. **(none)** means no platform page calls the command; a step marked "generic only" can be done only on the Keystone model pages, and "API only" means through GraphQL alone.

### W1. Inventory: acquisition → recon → merchandising → publish/feed → sale

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Appraise a unit you are sourcing | InventoryAcquisition, InventoryAcquisitionEvent | `startInventoryAcquisition` | **(none)** |
| 2 | Approve, purchase, arrive | InventoryAcquisition (+ event) | `transitionInventoryAcquisition` (appraised→approved→purchased→arrived) | **(none)**. `/platform/vehicles` only sends arrived→reconditioning and reconditioning→frontline. |
| 3 | Stock the unit: one-step intake, or create the vehicle and then stock it | Vehicle, VehicleImage, InventoryAcquisition, InventoryStock, InventoryStockEvent | `intakeInventoryVehicle` (one step), or `establishInventoryStock` after an acquisition | Intake dialog on `/platform/vehicles` (source is hardcoded to `dealer-transfer`). `establishInventoryStock`: **(none)**. |
| 4 | Move the unit between locations, record costs | InventoryStock, InventoryStockEvent | `moveInventoryStock`, `recordInventoryCost` | `/platform/vehicles` row menu (cost type is always `other`) |
| 5 | Recon work items | InventoryReconWorkItem, InventoryStock.reconStatus | `openInventoryReconWorkItem`, `transitionInventoryReconWorkItem` | `/platform/vehicles` step pills. Only the first open item is actionable, category is always `other`, and there is no cancel. |
| 6 | Edit listing content and photos | Vehicle, VehicleImage, InventoryStockEvent | `updateInventoryMerchandisingDraft`, `add/arrange/removeInventoryVehiclePhoto` | `/platform/vehicles` (price, mileage, description and photos only) |
| 7 | Submit the listing, then approve or reject it | InventoryMerchandisingVersion, InventoryStock | `submitInventoryMerchandising`, `decideInventoryMerchandising` | `/platform/vehicles`. Approve only: there is no reject and no version history. |
| 8 | Mark frontline (vehicle becomes `available`) | InventoryAcquisition, InventoryStock, Vehicle | `transitionInventoryAcquisition` →frontline | `/platform/vehicles` |
| 9 | Publish to the storefront and syndication feed | InventoryFeedRun, InventoryFeedError, InventoryStock.feedStatus | `recordInventoryFeedRun`. Storefront gate: `inventoryPublication.ts:60-66`. Public feed: `integrations/inventory/publicInventoryFeed.ts`, `app/api/inventory-feed/route.ts`. | `/platform/vehicles` "Publish feed" (single channel; errors always `[]`; no run history) |
| 10 | Condition report, history, price history | VehicleConditionReport, VehicleHistory, PriceHistory | none (open CRUD) | **(none)**; generic only |
| 11 | Sale | Vehicle.status pending→sold | through W3 (`transitionDeal` submit, `completeDealDelivery`) | Deal and delivery desks |

### W2. Lead intake → routing → engagement → test drive → deal

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| 6 | Approve or reject; reopen | Deal, DealApproval | `transitionDeal` →approved / cancelled; `reopenDealWorksheet` | `/platform/deals/[id]` and `/platform/finance` (approve, reject). Cancelling from pencil, approved or financed: **(none)**. |
| 7 | F&I: product quotes → present menu → customer decision | FinanceProductQuote, FinanceMenuVersion | `recordFinanceProductQuote`, `presentFinanceMenu`, `decideFinanceMenu` | `/platform/finance`. Quotes every product, presents every product, and the decision is all-or-nothing. |

| 14 | Complete delivery (Deal delivered, Vehicle sold) | Deal, Vehicle, DeliveryCase | `completeDealDelivery` | `/platform/delivery` |
| 15 | We-owe items | WeOweItem | `manageWeOweItem` | `/platform/delivery`. The owner is always the salesperson and the cost is always 0. |

### W4. Trade-in appraisal

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Request from the customer | TradeIn, Lead, Customer | `submitTradeIn` | Storefront `/trade-in` |

| 4 | Attach to a deal | Deal.tradeInVehicle | `createDealPencil` `tradeInId` (only at creation; the trade-in cannot be changed later, `Deal.ts:72`) | **(none)**. The deal create page sends a dollar trade-in value only. |
| 5 | Take the trade into inventory | InventoryAcquisition (`trade-in` source) | `startInventoryAcquisition` | **(none)** |

### W5. Financing application → lender submission → decision

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |

| 2 | Edit, assign a technician, record mileage and advisor notes | ServiceAppointment | none; open `updateServiceAppointment` | **(none)**; generic only |
| 3 | Check in → in progress → waiting for parts → completed / cancelled | ServiceAppointment | `transitionServiceAppointment` | `/platform/service`. Bug: the deterministic idempotency key makes a repeated move into the same status a silent no-op (`ServiceAdvisorPageClient.tsx:384` against `operatorWorkflows.ts:12-19`). |
| 4 | Open the RO (estimate) | ServiceOrder | `openServiceOrder` | `/platform/service` (totals start at 0) |
| 5 | Concern, cause, correction and authorization | ServiceOrder | `recordServiceOrderEvidence` | `/platform/service` |
| 6 | Line items | RepairOrderLineItem, ServiceOrder totals | `addServiceOrderLineItem` | `/platform/service`. Labor only: no part or sublet lines, and lines cannot be edited or removed. |

| 4 | Adjustments and cycle counts | PartsMovement | `recordPartsMovement` (`adjustment`, `count`) | **(none)** |
| 5 | Movement history | PartsMovement | read through `fixedOpsWorkspace.partsMovements` | **(none)** (the query returns it, but the desk does not render it) |

| 4 | Refund | PaymentRefund | `requestPaymentRefund` | `/platform/accounting` |
| 5 | Reconcile | PaymentTransaction.reconciledAt | `reconcilePaymentTransaction` | **(none)**. That also blocks staging payment accounting batches, which need a reconciled payment. |

### W10. Accounting batches and mappings

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Configure mappings | AccountingMapping | `configureAccountingMapping` | `/platform/accounting` (create only; rooftop is a raw ID) |
| 2 | Stage a batch from a delivered deal, paid RO, received PO or reconciled payment | AccountingBatch | `stageAccountingBatch` | `/platform/accounting` (raw source ID) |
| 3 | queue-post → record-posted / record-failed → reconcile → lock | AccountingBatch, AccountingProviderResponse | `manageAccountingBatch` | `/platform/accounting` sends queue-post, reconcile and lock only. **record-posted and record-failed have no UI**, so a batch stays in `posting`. |

### W11. Reporting

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Live operations metrics | read only | `operationalReport` | `/platform/overview`, `/platform/analytics` |
| 2 | Save a report | SavedReport | `saveOperationalReport` | **(none)** |
| 3 | Run it now, or queue the due ones | ReportRun | `runSavedReport`, `queueDueSavedReports` | **(none)** |
| 4 | Audit search and timelines | DomainAuditEvent | `auditSearch`, `domainTimeline` | Timelines on the deal, finance and delivery desks. `auditSearch`: **(none)**. |

### W12. Org setup: dealer group, rooftops, memberships, roles, staff

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bootstrap the group, rooftop, profile and memberships | DealerGroup, Rooftop, DealershipProfile, DealerGroupMembership, MembershipAuditEvent | `ensureDealershipOnboardingRecord` `Dealership` | Onboarding dialog (not a route) |
| 2 | Edit the group, add or edit rooftops | DealerGroup, Rooftop | open CRUD with `canManageDealerships` | Store settings edits one rooftop's time zone only. Everything else: **(none)**; generic only. |
| 3 | Staff accounts | User | generic `createUser` / `updateUser` / `deleteUser` | `/platform/users` |
| 4 | Roles and permission matrix | Role | open CRUD with `canManageRoles` | **(none)**; generic only |
| 5 | Grant, suspend or revoke rooftop and group access | DealerGroupMembership, RooftopMembership, MembershipAuditEvent | `changeDealerMembership` | **(none)**. No UI anywhere, so this is API only. |

### W13. Catalog setup

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Makes and models | Make, Model | open CRUD | **(none)**; generic only |
| 2 | Service packages (the storefront menu) | ServicePackage | open CRUD | **(none)**; generic only |
| 3 | F&I products | FinanceProduct | `configureFinanceProduct` | `/platform/finance` (create only, no catalog list, rooftop is implicit) |
| 4 | Lead routing rules | LeadRoutingRule | `configureLeadRoutingRule` | **(none)**; generic only |
| 5 | Dealership profile, tax and doc fee | DealershipProfile | open update | `/platform/store-settings` |

### W14. Retention policy and API keys

| # | Step | Lists | Command | Platform today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Retention policy per category, with legal hold | RetentionPolicy | **no command exists** (create denied) | **(none)** |
| 2 | API keys (create, scope, revoke) | ApiKey | open CRUD for the owner | **(none)**; generic only |

### W15. Also supported by the schema

- **Outbox and observability.** DomainOutboxEvent rows are always `pending` and no dispatcher exists here. An admin view of pending and failed rows has no page.
- **Customer account.** `registerCustomerAccount` and `customerRequestHistory` serve the storefront account (section 3.3).

---

## 3. Coverage

Verdicts come from reading each screen and its actions, not from page names.

- **Covered** means the page does the job the schema supports.
- **THIN** means a page exists but cannot do the job; the gap is named.
- **MISSING** means no platform page exists.

Child, log and system lists are judged through their parent page, which is named. Every wrapper under `app/dashboard/(admin)/platform/**` is a 3-line re-export, and nothing in the platform slices links to generic `/dashboard/<list>` pages except `/platform/users` ("Open full record").

### 3.1 Existing platform pages

| Route | Slice | Nav group | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard/platform/overview` | `features/platform/overview` | top | Read-only 30-day `operationalReport` |
| `/dashboard/platform/vehicles` | `features/platform/vehicles` | top ("Inventory") | Inventory desk: intake, listing edits, photos, recon pills, merchandising submit and approve, frontline, publish feed |
| `/dashboard/platform/deals`, `/deals/create`, `/deals/[id]` | `features/platform/deals` | top | Deal list, pencil create, worksheet, present, accept, lender select, submit, approve, reject, reopen |
| `/dashboard/platform/analytics` | `features/platform/analytics` | top | Read-only charts (500-record cap) |
| `/dashboard/platform/store-settings` | `features/platform/store-settings` | top | DealershipProfile and one rooftop's time zone |
| `/dashboard/platform/crm`, `/crm/[id]` | `features/platform/crm` | Sales | Lead list and board (read-only); lead detail with interactions, tasks, routing, consent, cadence, visits and status |
| `/dashboard/platform/test-drives` | `features/platform/test-drives` | Sales | Queue, schedule, verify, complete, no-show |
| `/dashboard/platform/trade-ins` | `features/platform/trade-ins` | Sales | Queue and offer entry |
| `/dashboard/platform/finance` | `features/platform/finance` | Finance | Deal F&I step plan, applications, lender queue and decision, products, quotes, menu, compliance, contract, review, funding, cancellations |
| `/dashboard/platform/delivery` | `features/platform/delivery` | Finance | Delivery case actions, complete delivery, we-owe items |
| `/dashboard/platform/accounting` | `features/platform/accounting` | Finance | Batch queue, reconcile and lock; checkout; refund; mapping create; stage |
| `/dashboard/platform/service` | `features/platform/service` | Service | Appointments, RO, CCC, labor lines and ops, parts configure and receive |
| `/dashboard/platform/users` | `features/platform/users` | Operations ("Staff") | Staff list with generic create, edit and delete drawers |

The nav is defined in `features/platform/lib/navigation.ts:36-68`. Onboarding is a dialog mounted in `features/dashboard/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`, not a route. `/dashboard` itself is the generic model-card grid (`features/dashboard/screens/HomePage`).

### 3.2 Coverage by list

| Domain | List | Platform page | Verdict | What is missing |

### 3.4 Storefront coverage by customer workflow

Customer submissions go through `features/storefront/actions/submissions.ts:24-48`. That sends the session as a Bearer token, so a request made while signed in is linked to the account. TestDrive and ServiceAppointment link through `requestedBy`; Lead, TradeIn and FinancingApplication link through the audit `actorId` (`mutations/customerAccount.ts:33-43`). The CRM Customer is never linked to the login User, so guest submissions are never claimed. Confirmation references are made on the client (`features/storefront/lib/customerRequests.ts:24-31`).

| Workflow | Browse | Detail | Request / book / buy | Confirmation | Account history |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vehicle shopping | Present: `/inventory` (`screens/InventoryPage.tsx:151`). Thin filters: make and model are free text, there are no body or colour filters, and `GET_MODELS` is unused. | Present: `/inventory/[id]` (`VehicleDetailPageClient.tsx:215-388`); compare at `/compare` | Present: question, quote or test drive modal → `submitInquiry` / `submitTestDrive` (`:111-168`) | Present: reference shown in the modal (`components/LeadCaptureModal.tsx:158-176`) | Thin: kind and status only, no vehicle, no quote (`customerAccount.ts:53`) |
| Test drive | Thin: vehicle only through `?vehicleId`, no picker (`TestDrivePage.tsx:53-63`) | n/a | Present: `/test-drive` → `submitTestDrive`. Slots are client-side only and the server does no capacity check. | Present (`TestDrivePage.tsx:113-147`), with no account link | Thin: requested or completed only; no cancel or reschedule |
| Trade-in | n/a | n/a | Present: `/trade-in` → `submitTradeIn` | Thin: the server's estimate (`submitTradeIn.ts:131-133`) is discarded (`TradeInPage.tsx:112`), even though the home tile promises "Value your vehicle" | Thin: submitted or appraised; the offer amount is never shown |
| Financing | Present: calculator (`FinancingPage.tsx:237-536`) | n/a | Thin: `/financing` → `submitFinancing` with a minimal application. `privacyAcknowledged` is never sent. There is no pre-qualification step, even though the home tile promises one. | Present (server reference, `:539-578`) | Thin: application status only, no lender decision |
| Service | Present: `/service` menu (`ServicePage.tsx:28-38`) | n/a | Present: `submitServiceBooking` (4 per hour capacity). The chosen package goes into free text only. | Present (`:177-192`) | Thin: status only. No cancel or reschedule, and the RO it becomes is not shown. |
| Buy / reserve / deposit | **Missing** | **Missing** | **Missing**: no checkout. `createPaymentCheckout` is staff-only (`paymentOperations.ts:34`). | **Missing** | **Missing** |
| Purchases (deals, delivery, we-owe) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | **Missing**: no customer query exists |
| Service orders, invoices, payments | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | **Missing**: no customer query exists |
| Account | n/a | n/a | Present: sign up (`registerCustomerAccount`), sign in, reset, profile (generic `updateUser`; the current password is not checked) | n/a | Thin: `/account` flat list of up to 50 requests (`screens/AccountPage.tsx:146-175`) with no detail pages |
| Contact | n/a | n/a | Present: `/contact` → `submitInquiry` | Present | Thin (same as an inquiry) |
| CMS pages | **Missing**: `[...slug]` always calls `notFound()` | | | | |

## 4. Recommended build list

Ordered by how much merchant work is blocked today. Each slice follows the E-commerce pattern: a thin wrapper at `app/dashboard/(admin)/platform/<slice>/`, logic in `features/platform/<slice>/`, and a nav entry in `features/platform/lib/navigation.ts`.

### P1. Blocking gaps (work that cannot be done at all, or gets stuck)

| # | Slice / route | Build | Lists | Existing commands | Genuinely missing command |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **access**: `/platform/access` (or tabs on `/platform/users`) | Members per rooftop and group: grant, suspend and revoke with a reason; role per scope; a membership audit list; a roles and permission-matrix editor | DealerGroupMembership, RooftopMembership, MembershipAuditEvent, Role, User | `changeDealerMembership`; open Role CRUD | None. Also fix the `STAFF_WHERE` refetch in users. |
| 2 | **parts**: `/platform/parts`, `/parts/[id]` | Parts catalog (edit, bin, cost, min, supplier); ledger per part; movement drawer covering every type; RO parts commit, issue and return from the RO; purchase orders (create, order, receive, cancel) | PartsInventory, PartsMovement, PartsPurchaseOrder, ServiceOrder | `configurePart`, `recordPartsMovement`, `managePartsPurchaseOrder`, `fixedOpsWorkspace` | **Receiving a PO should post `receipt` movements and clear on-order quantities.** Today `managePartsPurchaseOrder` receive only changes the status, and nothing sets `partially-received`. Either extend it or post the movements from the action. |
| 3 | **accounting** rebuild: `/platform/accounting`, `/accounting/batches/[id]`, `/accounting/payments/[id]` | Batch detail (lines, provider responses); record-posted and record-failed actions; source pickers instead of raw IDs; mapping edit and delete with a rooftop picker; payment detail with webhook events; reconcile action | AccountingBatch, AccountingProviderResponse, AccountingMapping, PaymentTransaction, PaymentRefund, PaymentProviderEvent | `manageAccountingBatch` (all 5 actions), `stageAccountingBatch`, `configureAccountingMapping`, `reconcilePaymentTransaction`, `createPaymentCheckout`, `requestPaymentRefund` | None. Mapping delete is open CRUD; `accountingWorkspace` needs `AccountingProviderResponse` and `PaymentProviderEvent` added to the read, or a detail query. |
| 4 | **service** rebuild: `/platform/service`, `/service/orders/[id]`, `/service/appointments/[id]` | RO detail page: part and sublet lines; labor ops list with every action (pause, cancel, reassign); tax; settle to paid. Appointment edit (technician, mileage, notes, time). Fix the deterministic transition key. | ServiceOrder, RepairOrderLineItem, ServiceLaborOperation, ServiceAppointment, PartsMovement | `transitionServiceOrder` (incl. `paid`), `addServiceOrderLineItem`, `manageLaborOperation`, `recordServiceOrderEvidence`, `transitionServiceAppointment`, `openServiceOrder`; open `updateServiceAppointment` | **Edit or remove a line item** and **set RO tax** (no command; RepairOrderLineItem is command-only). Optional: a command for appointment edits, so they are audited. |
| 5 | **inventory** rebuild: `/platform/vehicles/[id]` plus an acquisitions view | Vehicle detail: identity and spec edit, stock ledger, cost list (all cost types), every recon item with category, assignee and cancel, merchandising history with approve and reject, feed run history and errors, condition report, vehicle history, price history. Acquisition pipeline: start, approve, purchase, arrive, cancel, then stock. | Vehicle, InventoryStock, InventoryStockEvent, InventoryReconWorkItem, InventoryMerchandisingVersion, InventoryFeedRun, InventoryFeedError, InventoryAcquisition (+ event), VehicleConditionReport, VehicleHistory, PriceHistory | `startInventoryAcquisition`, `transitionInventoryAcquisition`, `establishInventoryStock`, `recordInventoryCost`, `openInventoryReconWorkItem`, `transitionInventoryReconWorkItem`, `decideInventoryMerchandising` (rejected), `recordInventoryFeedRun`, `domainTimeline`; open CRUD for condition, history and price history | **Edit vehicle identity and spec** (VIN, year, make, model, trim, colours, condition, features, list price). Vehicle is command-only, and `updateInventoryMerchandisingDraft` covers price, mileage, description and image only. **Append PriceHistory on price change** (no writer today). |

### P2. Thin desks that need their missing actions

| # | Slice / route | Build | Lists | Existing commands | Missing command |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **customers**: `/platform/customers`, `/customers/[id]` | Customer directory and detail (leads, visits, consent history, household); duplicate review and merge; household link | Customer, CustomerMergeEvent, CustomerHousehold, CustomerContactPreferenceEvent, Lead, SalesVisit | `customerDuplicateCandidates`, `mergeCustomers`, `linkCustomerHousehold`, `updateCustomerCommunicationPreferences` | None |
| 7 | **crm** rebuild | Lead create; lead edit; manual reassign; assignment history; visit scheduling with kind and time, cancel and no-show; showroom up-log; a "my tasks" queue | Lead, LeadAssignmentEvent, SalesVisit, Task | `transferLeadOwnership`, `manageSalesVisit` (cancel, no-show, showroom), `createLeadTask`, `completeTask` | **`createLead`** (staff walk-in or phone intake with customer find-or-create; the only route today is borrowing `submitTestDrive` or `submitServiceBooking`). **`updateLeadDetails`** (contact, source, budget, timeframe, notes, interested vehicle). Lead is `denyAll`. |
| 8 | **trade-ins** rebuild: `/platform/trade-ins/[id]` | Walk-in create, condition edit, reference value plus offer, attach to a pencil deal, "send to inventory" | TradeIn, Deal, InventoryAcquisition | Open `createTradeIn` / `updateTradeIn` (condition fields), `recordTradeInAppraisal`, `startInventoryAcquisition` (source `trade-in`), `createDealPencil` `tradeInId` | **Attach or detach a trade-in on an existing pencil deal.** The Deal validate hook forbids changing `tradeInVehicle` (`Deal.ts:72`), and `saveDealWorksheet` does not take it. |
| 9 | **finance** rebuild: add `/platform/finance/products` and an application detail | F&I product catalog (edit, deactivate, per rooftop); per-product quote entry; menu with per-product choices; cancellations list with a link to a refund; application detail; lender choice | FinanceProduct, FinanceProductQuote, FinanceMenuVersion, FinanceProductCancellation, FinancingApplication, LenderSubmission, LenderDecision, PaymentRefund | `configureFinanceProduct`, `recordFinanceProductQuote`, `presentFinanceMenu` (subset `productCodes`), `decideFinanceMenu`, `recordFinanceProductCancellation`, `requestPaymentRefund`, `queueFinancingApplication` | Optional: link a FinanceProductCancellation to a PaymentRefund (no field or command connects them) |
| 10 | **deals**: small additions | Lease structure fields; cancel from pencil, approved or financed; prefill the lead and vehicle from the CRM link; pick a TradeIn record at create | Deal | `saveDealWorksheet` (lease fields), `transitionDeal` →cancelled, `createDealPencil` `tradeInId` | None |
| 11 | **delivery**: small additions | Reschedule and cancel the case; waive a checklist item; we-owe owner and cost | DeliveryCase, WeOweItem | `manageDeliveryCase` (`schedule` again, `cancel`; checklist `waived`), `manageWeOweItem` (`ownerId`) | `estimatedCostCents` is create-time only. Optional: an edit action on `manageWeOweItem`. |

### P3. Catalog, configuration and reporting slices

| # | Slice / route | Build | Lists | Existing commands | Missing command |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | **catalog**: `/platform/catalog` (tabs: Makes and models, Service packages, Lead routing) | CRUD for Make and Model; service menu CRUD (the storefront `/service` reads it); routing rules with priority, source, assignee, SLA and active | Make, Model, ServicePackage, LeadRoutingRule | Open CRUD (Make, Model, ServicePackage); `configureLeadRoutingRule` | None |
| 13 | **dealership**: `/platform/dealership` (or tabs in store-settings) | Dealer group edit; rooftop list, create and edit (status, slug, time zone, currency); payment providers | DealerGroup, Rooftop, PaymentProvider | Open CRUD with `canManageDealerships` / `canManagePayments` | None. Align the currency rule with onboarding (USD only). |
| 14 | **reports**: `/platform/reports` | Saved reports, run now, run history and downloads, audit search, outbox health | SavedReport, ReportRun, DomainAuditEvent, DomainOutboxEvent | `saveOperationalReport`, `runSavedReport`, `queueDueSavedReports`, `auditSearch` | Queued ReportRuns are never processed (no worker), and saved filters are rejected ("not supported yet"). Outbox needs a read query; generic read needs `canViewReports`. |
| 15 | **settings: API keys and retention**: `/platform/api-keys`, `/platform/retention` | Own keys: create (show the token once), scopes, IP limits, revoke. Retention policy per category, with legal hold. | ApiKey, RetentionPolicy | Open ApiKey CRUD (owner) | **`configureRetentionPolicy`**: RetentionPolicy create and update are denied and nothing writes it. Also there is no sweeper that reads it. |

### Storefront flows to add

| # | Flow | Routes | Lists | Commands | Missing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Account request detail and purchases** | `/account/requests/[kind]/[id]`, `/account/purchases`, `/account/service` | Lead, TestDrive, TradeIn, FinancingApplication, ServiceAppointment, Deal, DeliveryCase, WeOweItem, ServiceOrder, PaymentTransaction | `customerRequestHistory` (list only) | **Customer-scoped read queries** for request detail, deals and delivery, ROs and invoices, and payments. Every one of these lists is staff-read only today. Also link Customer to User (or claim guest submissions by email), so history is complete. |
| S2 | **Show the trade-in estimate** | `/trade-in` confirmation | TradeIn | `submitTradeIn` already returns estimatedMin, estimatedMax and estimateMode | None. This is a UI change only. |
| S3 | **Cancel or reschedule a test drive or service booking** | account request detail | TestDrive, ServiceAppointment | `transitionServiceAppointment` is staff-only | **Customer cancel and reschedule commands**, with requestedBy ownership checks |
| S4 | **Reserve or deposit online** | `/inventory/[id]` → `/checkout/deposit` → confirmation → account | PaymentTransaction, Deal or a reservation, Vehicle | `createPaymentCheckout` (staff-only; needs an approved deal) | **A customer deposit command** (create a pencil deal or hold plus a checkout for the deposit amount) and webhook handling for it |
| S5 | **Financing completeness** | `/financing` | FinancingApplication | `submitFinancing` | Send `privacyAcknowledged` (UI only). True pre-qualification needs a provider adapter. |
| S6 | **Structured service package booking** | `/service` | ServiceAppointment | `submitServiceBooking` | Add a package ID input and field (today it is free text in the description) |
| S7 | **Test drive vehicle picker and capacity** | `/test-drive` | TestDrive | `submitTestDrive` | Server-side slot capacity, the same as service bookings |
| S8 | **CMS pages** (about, privacy, terms) | `[...slug]` | none | none | No content list exists. Either static pages, or a new `Page` list. |

### Bugs found while reading (fix alongside the rebuilds)

- `features/platform/service/screens/ServiceAdvisorPageClient.tsx:384`: the appointment transition idempotency key is `service-appointment:${id}:${status}`. A second in-progress ↔ waiting-parts move replays silently (`mutations/operatorWorkflows.ts:12-19`).
- `features/platform/accounting`: there is no record-posted or record-failed action, so staged batches can never reach `posted`.
- `features/platform/users/screens/UserListPageClient.tsx:133-142`: the client refetch drops `STAFF_WHERE`.
- `features/platform/onboarding/hooks/useOnboardingApi.ts:56-58`: a retry after a partial failure is refused, because a rooftop already exists.
- `features/platform/finance/screens/FinanceDeskPageClient.tsx:317`: F&I products are created on the first deal's rooftop.
- Analytics: "today" uses the server's day boundary, and inventory age uses `Vehicle.createdAt` instead of `stockedAt` (`features/platform/analytics/actions/metrics.ts:358-363`).
